           A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.</p>

             Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks. A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a computer system. This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster.

           <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
              <p>A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for instructing a computer or computing device to
                perform specific tasks. The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++,
                COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal..</p>
              <b><a id="c">C</a></b>
              <p>
                 C is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope,
                  and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations.
              </p>
              <b><a id="c++">C<sup>++</sup></a></b>
              <p>
                 C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language,
                 or "C with Classes"

                 <p>A database management system (DBMS) is system software for creating and managing databases. The DBMS provides users and
                      programmers with a systematic way to create, retrieve, update and manage data.A DBMS makes it possible for end users to 
                      create, read, update and delete data in a database.</p>

                 <p>
                      A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a collection of programs and capabilities that enable IT teams and
                      others to create, update, administer and otherwise interact with a relational database.
                 </p>

                 <p>
                     OODBMS stands for Object-Oriented Database Management System. An object-oriented database management system
                     (also known simply as an object database ) is a DBMS where data is represented in the form of objects,
                     as used in object-oriented programming

                        A hierarchical database model is a data model in which the data is organized into a tree-like structure. ... 
                        A record in the hierarchical database model corresponds to a row in the relational database model and an entity
                         type corresponds to a table
